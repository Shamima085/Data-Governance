## Project Overview
# Background

SneakerPark is an online shoe reseller that allows people to buy and sell used and new shoes. Buyers can bid for shoes or buy them outright, and sellers can set a price or sell to the highest bidder.
Each buyer and seller must have an active account in order to sell, bid, or purchase sneakers using SneakerPark’s website.
SneakerPark authenticates the shoes before shipping them to the buyer, so before listing an item, the seller must ship it to SneakerPark’s warehouse. Upon receipt, SneakerPark assigns an item number to each pair of sneakers and notifies the seller that they are now free to list their item. If the item is not listed within 45 days, SneakerPark returns it to the seller and sends an invoice to the seller for the shipping cost.
If the item is found to be inauthentic or in an unacceptable condition, it is also returned back to the seller in a similar fashion.
When the item sells, the buyer’s account is credited with the purchase price minus the SneakerPark service fee and shipping fees to deliver the item to the buyer.
Currently, SneakerPark only supports sales within the United States.

Below you can see a diagram that will hopefully help you visualize some of SneakerPark's business processes. Keep in mind that it does not capture ALL processes and every nuance, but simply serves as another artifact to use in your project.
